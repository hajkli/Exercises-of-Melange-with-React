 ; Here's the list of dependencies of the stanza. In this case (being
 ; `melange.emit`), Dune will look into those dependencies and generate rules

 ; Caveat: the libraries need to be specified with `(modes melange)`.

 ; The `preprocess` field lists preprocessors which transform code before it is
 ; compiled. These enable, for example, the use of JSX in .re files.
